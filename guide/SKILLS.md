## What Are Skills?

Skills are specialized knowledge modules that enhance Claude's capabilities in specific domains. Each skill provides:

- **Domain expertise** - Deep knowledge in a specific technology or framework
- **Best practices** - Industry-standard patterns and approaches
- **Practical workflows** - Step-by-step implementation guides
- **Code examples** - Ready-to-use code snippets and templates

## How to Use Skills

Skills are invoked automatically when Claude detects relevant context in your request. You can also explicitly invoke a skill:

```bash
# Automatic invocation
claude "How do I implement OAuth with Better Auth?"

# List all available skills
ls .claude/skills/
```

Skills work seamlessly with slash commands:

```bash
/plan "implement authentication with Better Auth"
/cook "create Docker containers for the app"
/design "create a landing page with shadcn/ui"
```
